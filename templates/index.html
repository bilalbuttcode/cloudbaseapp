            <h2>What is Malware?</h2>
            <p>
                Malware, short for "malicious software," refers to any software intentionally designed to cause damage
                to a computer, server, client, or computer network. It acts against the interests of the computer user
                and can take many forms, often disguising its true intent. The primary purpose of malware is to
                infiltrate, damage, or disable computers and computer systems, steal, encrypt, or delete data, monitor
                or manipulate computer activity without the user's permission, and covertly report data to third-party
                entities.<br>

                Malware is a broad term that encompasses various types of malicious programs, including viruses, worms,
                trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and others. Each type has its specific way of infecting and
                damaging computers, networks, or data.<br>

                The impact of malware can range from minor annoyances to significant financial loss and breaches of
                personal and organizational data. Given its harmful nature, understanding, detecting, and protecting
                against malware is crucial in maintaining computer security and user privacy.</p><br>

            <h2>Types of Malware</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Virus:</strong> A type of malware that attaches itself to clean files and spreads to other
                    clean files. It can spread uncontrollably, damaging a system's core functionality and deleting or
                    corrupting files.</li>
                <li><strong>Worm:</strong> A type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. A
                    worm can replicate itself without any human interaction and does not need to attach itself to a
                    software program to cause damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Trojan Horse:</strong> A type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software. Users
                    are tricked into loading and executing Trojans on their systems, at which point they are capable of
                    damaging, disrupting, stealing, or inflicting harm on data or network systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> A type of malware that encrypts a user's files and demands payment in
                    exchange for the decryption key. Ransomware is often spread through phishing emails or by visiting
                    an infected website.</li>
                <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> A type of malware that hides in your device, spying on your activity and
                    collecting sensitive information like bank details or passwords. It can be used to monitor your
                    internet activity and perform other malicious tasks without your knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>Adware:</strong> Often bundled with free software, adware can track your browsing patterns
                    to display unwanted ads. While not always malicious in intent, aggressive adware can undermine your
                    security just to serve you ads â€” which can give other malware an easy way in.</li>
                <li><strong>Rootkit:</strong> A type of malware that provides privileged access to the computer while
                    concealing its presence. Rootkits can be installed by a malicious third party, or by malware. Once
                    installed, it allows the attackers to mask intrusion and gain root or privileged access to the
                    computer.</li>
                <li><strong>Keylogger:</strong> Also known as a keystroke logger, this type of malware records the
                    keystrokes you make on your keyboard, typically to steal passwords or other sensitive information.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Botnets:</strong> Networks of infected computers that are made to work together under the
                    control of an attacker. Botnets can be used to perform Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks,
                    steal data, send spam, and allows the attacker to access the device and its connection.</li>
                <li><strong>Fileless Malware:</strong> A type of malicious activity that uses legitimate programs to
                    infect a computer. Unlike traditional malware, fileless malware does not download code onto a user's
                    system. Instead, it's capable of hiding its existence by piggybacking on software that is allowed to
                    execute commands on the system.</li>

            <h2>How to Detect Malware</h2>
            <p>Detecting malware involves a combination of vigilant observation, technical measures, and the use of
                specialized tools. Users and administrators can monitor for common signs of infection such as system
                slowdowns, unexpected behavior, or unauthorized changes to files. On a technical level, antivirus and
                anti-malware software play a crucial role in detection, utilizing signature-based detection to identify
                known malware, and heuristic analysis to detect new, unknown threats by examining behavior and
                properties. Network monitoring tools can detect unusual traffic patterns or unauthorized data transfers
                indicative of a malware infection. Regularly updating software, operating systems, and security programs
                is also vital, as updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that malware might exploit.
                Ultimately, a layered security approach, combining user vigilance with robust technical defenses, is the
                most effective strategy for detecting and protecting against malware.</p>
